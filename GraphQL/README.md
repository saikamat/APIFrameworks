# FastAPI + Strawberry GraphQL â€” Books API


## What is GraphQL?
In simple terms, `GraphQL` is a query language for APIs. The client makes a request to a single URL and gets gets to choose exactly what they want.

The single URL is a single endpoint: `/graphql` instead of multiple REST API endpoints. All queries are routed through this single query that understands the Schema.

## Components of GraphQL
1. Schema - A strong rigid structure that defines the following:-
   1. Type - e.g. `book`, `author` and what fields they have
   2. Operations
      1. query - to read data
      2. mutation - to create, update, delete data
2. Resolver
Functions that fetch data or computes the value for a given field in your schema.

For example, 
- the `books` query calls a resolver. 
- Resolver returns list of `book` objects from database of in-memory store

python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd GraphQL
